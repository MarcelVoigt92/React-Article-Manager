# My Articles

Welcome to the "My Articles" project!

This project is a simple React application that allows users to view articles and also post their own articles. The project includes a homepage that displays all articles, an "About" page, a "Contact" page, and a page for posting articles.

The navigation bar makes it easy for users to navigate through the different pages of the application. On the "Contact" page, users can send a message to the administrator of the site. Additionally, users can add pictures to their articles to make them more visually appealing. The pictures are added using a form that asks for the image URL.

The data from the "Contact" page and the "Post Article" page is sent to the server for processing.

This project has been created using React and CSS.
